`parent` is a module, written in TypeScript, of mostly type declarations.
The `types` field in its `package.json` points to its source TypeScript
entrypoint and the `main` field points to its compiled JavaScript entrypoint.
It has a `tsconfig.json` used by its `build` script.

`child` is a module, written in TypeScript, that depends on `parent`. It has
a `tsconfig.json` and wants to build a bundle with Rollup.

After setting up:

```
cd child
yarn
```

This works:

```
npx tsc --project tsconfig.json --outDir out --module esnext
```

It produces the expected output at `out/index.js`:

```js
import parent from 'parent';
console.log(parent);
```

(This is exactly the same as the source TypeScript, but that's
just a coincidence.)

This doesn't work:

```
npx rollup --config
```

The error is this:

```

I'm suspecting that Rollup successfully compiles the `child` module to an
ESNext module that includes the line `import parent from 'parent'`, and
instead of resolving that module specifier to the _JavaScript_ in the parent
module, it resolves it to the TypeScript, which includes a line that is not
valid JavaScript (`import type Parent from './Parent'`).
How can I fix this?
